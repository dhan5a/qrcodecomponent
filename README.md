## Overview

I built a QR code component, utilising HTML5 and CSS3. 

Some things to note:

Padding was quite challenging, as I had to imitate the design and make sure the text position is exactly identical to the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to use width:min() which I learnt from the NFT preview card component challenge. Applying width: min() allows the component to be responsive for different browser sizes.
